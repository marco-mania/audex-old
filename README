COMPILE AND INSTALL

You need Qt 4.3.x (with SQL, Network, XML) and CDDA Paranoia libs III 9.8.

Audex is not platform independent, as it is linked against cdda paranoia. 
It has been tested only with linux by now, but should also work with all 
unix-platforms coming up with Qt 4 and CDDA Paranoia. I'm decided to make 
use of trolltechs really great make-generator-tool qmake.

To compile the sources you need to type in the source directory: 
 qmake -project

Now open a file called like the directory with the extension ".pro" with a 
texteditor and add the following lines at the end:
 QT += sql
 QT += xml
 QT += network
 LIBS += -lcdda_paranoia -lcdda_interface

Now you are ready to initiate the compiling process: 
 qmake
 make
